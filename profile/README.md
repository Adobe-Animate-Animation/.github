## What is Adobe Animate?

**Adobe Animate** is a powerful multimedia authoring and computer animation software developed by Adobe Inc. It is used to design vector graphics and animation for television series, online animation, websites, web applications, rich web applications, game development, and other interactive projects.

Animate offers support for raster graphics, rich text, audio and video embedding, and complex animation via ActionScript scripting. Its ability to export to various formats, including HTML5 Canvas, WebGL, Flash/Adobe AIR, and custom platforms, makes it incredibly versatile for animators and interactive designers.

With Adobe Animate, creators can bring their ideas to life through:
- Advanced **vector-based drawing** tools.
- A powerful timeline for creating **frame-by-frame animations**.
- The ability to create **interactive content** for games and apps.
- Seamless integration with other **Adobe Creative Cloud** apps.
